# Creative Installer
Creative Installer is a cooperative project to act as a replacement for Adobe's Extension Manager.

##Project Objectives
* Offer a easy way for developers to deploy scripts, extensions and plugins for their end users.
* Support all major versions of the creative apps
* Allow installation into specific versions of the creative apps.
* Support product updates
* Provide a method for bypassing the requirement to have extensions digitally signed. (This option will be user-selectable to allow end users to pick the level of security they want.)
* Compile template files and sample build scripts to make building native installers easier.

##Some Possible Objectives
* Provide a method for automatic updates of products.

##Technologies Used
We have not finalized what technologies we will use for the installation application, but we are leaning towards an AIR app. For the native installer templates: For Mac they will likely be for Iceberg, Packages and Package Maker, with sample code for creatibg dmg images and digital signing. For Windows installers, it will probably be Inno Setup files.
We intend to start work on this within the next week. If you would like to help out, please email Harbs. harbs@in-tools.com All ideas welcome!
